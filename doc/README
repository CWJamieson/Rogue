Compilation

    to compile, use the line:

    make
    
    while in the A2 directory
    
    to delete the created .exe and .o files, use
    
    make clean

Usage

    to run the program, use the line:

    ./A3 assets/template

    where "assets/template" is the path to the level file

    Alternatively, if using the preloaded hard/easy.txt files,
    one can use the lines:
    
    make playEasy
    make playHard


Testing

    Original A2 Testing:
        In level file:
            largest possible room
                -originally caused overlap (fixed)
            smallest possible room
                -no problem
            all items
                -weak enimies in the same room would be the same (fixed)
            double digit item locations
                -only read first digit (fixed);

        While running:
            wall collision
                -ran through walls (fixed)
            enemy collision
                -no errors
            item collision
                -no errors
            door travel
                -you would break down doors (fixed)
            stairs
                -you would collect them (fixed)
            gold collection
                -gold would not be random (fixed)
            the randomness of gold picked up (tested to ensure an
                 apropriate level of randomness)
                 
    A3 Testing:
        Status Bar & notifications:
            Tested with negative and edge values
                -problems only arise if numbers become long enough to overwrite border
            Tested all notifications
                -originally shorter lines could leave old lines exposed (fixed)
                -all display correct output at correct time
        Hallways:
            Generation is psudeo-random
                -any wall to wall connetion will follow a similar path with slight variations
            rooms are connected horizontally with 2 vertical conections on each end
            Tested every combination
            initial failure on west-west walls (fixed)
        Inventory, Item stats and Item use:
            Potions
                -no errors
            Iventory
                -seg fault when 5 items are picked up (fixed)
            item stats
                -random numbers could not be appended to the end of the item string (fixed)
        Player and Enemy stats:
            Player stats
                -player would not die when health < 1 (fixed)
            Enemy Stats
                -Aquators would not check to see if they were dead (fixed)
        Combat:
            Aquators would get negative health and start dealing normal damage (fixed) 
            
        

Known Limitations

    If the incorrect number of arguments or the wrong file path
         is given, an appropriate message will be displayed and 
         the program will exit.
    
    if the level file is incorrectly formatted, errors will arize
        for example, if a level size is negative, the character
        will be unable to move
